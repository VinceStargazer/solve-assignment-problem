# Run the demo
1. Locate `Demo` under `src/` directory
2. You can see `new FileParser()` takes a string as input. Keep the 
original content `test/trueTest` or change it to another
test file you can locate under `test/` directory, such as `test/test10`
3. (Optional) Change `new KuhnMunkres()` to `new Backtrack()` if you
want to see the output generated by backtracking rather than Kuhn Munkres
4. Compile and run this program. You can find the result in standard
out and compare it with the input file

# Test the program
1. We have already provided a test program called `AsgmtTest` under
`src/` directory
2. Import the latest version of JUnit to your IDEA
3. Run the method `testAccuracy()`, which is used to test whether
`Backtrack.java` and `KuhnMunkres.java` yield the same results
given the same test file input
4. Run the method `testPerformance()`, which is used to compare
between the performance of `Backtrack.java` and `KuhnMunkres.java`
under different constraints.
5. (Optional) Alternatively, you also create your own program
that utilizes `Backtrack.java` and `KuhnMunkres.java` to solve
a customized balanced assignment problem. Note that to initialize
a new instance, you need to pass an array of worker names, an array
of task names, and a 2d array showcasing the preference of each
task (column-indexed) for each worker (row-indexed). For example,
`SolveAssignment solution = new KuhnMunkres(proficiencies, workers, tasks)`
